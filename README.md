## Overview
Uniferum is a volumetric vision-language model designed for radiology. Uniferum integrates classification labels and segmentation masks into a single unified training framework.

- Harmonizes classification and segmentation across multiple CT datasets.
- Improves State-of-the-Art Results on the CT-RATE benchmark by +7% compared to CLIP-based models.
- Robust out-of-distribution performance
- zero-shot capabilities on RAD-CHEST and INSPECT datasets.
